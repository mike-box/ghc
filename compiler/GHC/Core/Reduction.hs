Note [The Reduction type]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Many functions in the type-checker rewrite a type, using Given type equalities
or type-family reductions, and return a Reduction:

  data Reduction = Reduction Type Coercion !Type

When we rewrite ty at role r, producing Reduction ty' dco xi, we guarantee:

  RW1: ty' is equal to ty (up to zonking)
  RW2: followDCo r ty' dco is equal to xi (up to zonking)

In particular, this means that `dco :: ty' ~r xi`. Note that we need to use ty',
and not ty, to satisfy RW2; see Note [The Hydration invariant] in GHC.Core.Coercion.
It could be the case that `followDCo r ty dco` crashes, e.g. if `ty` is a metavariable
and `dco = TyConAppDCo ..`. This is why we store the LHS type in the Reduction too.

The order of the arguments to the constructor serves as a reminder
of what the Type is.  In

    Reduction ty' dco xi

the original type ty appears to the left, and the result appears on the right,
reminding us that we must have:

  dco :: ty' ~r xi

Example functions that use this datatype:

   GHC.Core.FamInstEnv.topNormaliseType_maybe
     :: FamInstEnvs -> Type -> Maybe Reduction
   GHC.Tc.Solver.Rewrite.rewrite
     :: CtEvidence -> TcType -> TcS Reduction

Having Reduction as a data type, with a strict Type field, rather than using
a tuple (with all fields lazy), gives several advantages (see #20161)
* The strictness in Type improved performance in rewriting of type families
  (around 2.5% improvement in T9872),
* Compared to the situation before, it gives improved consistency around
  orientation of rewritings, as a Reduction is always left-to-right
  (the coercion's RHS type is always the type stored in the 'Reduction').
  No more 'mkSymCo's needed to convert between left-to-right and right-to-left.

The function below morally belongs in GHC.Tc.Solver.Rewrite, but it is used also in
FamInstEnv, and so lives here.

Note [simplifyArgsWorker]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Invariant (F2) of Note [Rewriting] in GHC.Tc.Solver.Rewrite says that
rewriting is homogeneous.
This causes some trouble when rewriting a function applied to a telescope
of arguments, perhaps with dependency. For example, suppose

  type family F :: forall (j :: Type) (k :: Type). Maybe j -> Either j k -> Bool -> [k]

and we wish to rewrite the args of (with kind applications explicit)

  F @a @b (Just @a c) (Right @a @b d) False

where all variables are skolems and

  a :: Type
  b :: Type
  c :: a
  d :: b

  [G] aco :: a ~ fa
  [G] bco :: b ~ fb
  [G] cco :: c ~ fc
  [G] dco :: d ~ fd

The first step is to rewrite all the arguments. This is done before calling
simplifyArgsWorker. We start from

  a
  b
  Just @a c
  Right @a @b d
  False

and get left-to-right reductions whose coercions are as follows:

  co1 :: a ~ fa
  co2 :: b ~ fb
  co3 :: (Just @a c) ~ (Just @fa (fc |> aco) |> co6)
  co4 :: (Right @a @b d) ~ (Right @fa @fb (fd |> bco) |> co7)
  co5 :: False ~ False

where
  co6 = Maybe (sym aco) :: Maybe fa ~ Maybe a
  co7 = Either (sym aco) (sym bco) :: Either fa fb ~ Either a b

We now process the rewritten args in left-to-right order. The first two args
need no further processing. But now consider the third argument. Let f3 = the rewritten
result, Just fa (fc |> aco) |> co6.
This f3 rewritten argument has kind (Maybe a), due to homogeneity of rewriting (F2).
And yet, when we build the application (F @fa @fb ...), we need this
argument to have kind (Maybe fa), not (Maybe a). We must cast this argument.
The coercion to use is determined by the kind of F:
we see in F's kind that the third argument has kind Maybe j.
Critically, we also know that the argument corresponding to j
(in our example, a) rewrote with a coercion co1. We can thus know the
coercion needed for the 3rd argument is (Maybe co1), thus building
(f3 |> Maybe co1)

More generally, we must use the Lifting Lemma, as implemented in
Coercion.liftCoSubst. As we work left-to-right, any variable that is a
dependent parameter (j and k, in our example) gets mapped in a lifting context
to the coercion that is output from rewriting the corresponding argument (co1
and co2, in our example). Then, after rewriting later arguments, we lift the
kind of these arguments in the lifting context that we've be building up.
This coercion is then used to keep the result of rewriting well-kinded.

Working through our example, this is what happens:

  1. Extend the (empty) LC with [j |-> co1]. No new casting must be done,
     because the binder associated with the first argument has a closed type (no
     variables).

  2. Extend the LC with [k |-> co2]. No casting to do.

  3. Lifting the kind (Maybe j) with our LC
     yields co8 :: Maybe a ~ Maybe fa. Use (f3 |> co8) as the argument to F.

  4. Lifting the kind (Either j k) with our LC
     yields co9 :: Either a b ~ Either fa fb. Use (f4 |> co9) as the 4th
     argument to F, where f4 is the rewritten form of argument 4, written above.

  5. We lift Bool with our LC, getting <Bool>; casting has no effect.

We're now almost done, but the new application

  F @fa @fb (f3 |> co8) (f4 |> co9) False

has the wrong kind. Its kind is [fb], instead of the original [b].
So we must use our LC one last time to lift the result kind [k],
getting res_co :: [fb] ~ [b], and we cast our result.

Accordingly, the final result is

  F
    @fa
    @fb
    (Just @fa (fc |> aco) |> Maybe (sym aco) |> sym (Maybe (sym aco)))
    (Right @fa @fb (fd |> bco) |> Either (sym aco) (sym bco) |> sym (Either (sym aco) (sym bco)))
    False
  |> [sym bco]

The res_co (in this case, [sym bco]) is the third component of the
tuple returned by simplifyArgsWorker.

Note [Last case in simplifyArgsWorker]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In writing simplifyArgsWorker's `go`, we know here that args cannot be empty,
because that case is first. We've run out of
binders. But perhaps inner_ki is a tyvar that has been instantiated with a
Π-type.

Here is an example.

  a :: forall (k :: Type). k -> k
  Proxy :: forall j. j -> Type
  type family Star
  axStar :: Star ~ Type
  type family NoWay :: Bool
  axNoWay :: NoWay ~ False
  bo :: Type
  [G] bc :: bo ~ Bool   (in inert set)

  co :: (forall j. j -> Type) ~ (forall (j :: Star). (j |> axStar) -> Star)
  co = forall (j :: sym axStar). (<j> -> sym axStar)

  We are rewriting:
  a (forall (j :: Star). (j |> axStar) -> Star)   -- 1
    (Proxy |> co)                                 -- 2
    (bo |> sym axStar)                            -- 3
    (NoWay |> sym bc)                             -- 4
      :: Star

First, we rewrite all the arguments (before simplifyArgsWorker), like so:

    co1 :: (forall (j :: Star). (j |> axStar) -> Star) ~ (forall j. j -> Type) -- 1
    co2 :: (Proxy |> co) ~ (Proxy |> co)                                       -- 2
    co3 :: (bo |> sym axStar) ~ (Bool |> sym axStar)                           -- 3
    co4 :: (NoWay |> sym bc) ~ (False |> sym bc)                               -- 4

Then we do the process described in Note [simplifyArgsWorker].

1. Lifting Type (the kind of the first arg) gives us a reflexive coercion, so we
   don't use it. But we do build a lifting context [k -> co1] (where co1 is a
   result of rewriting an argument, written above).

2. Lifting k gives us co1, so the second argument becomes (Proxy |> co |> co1).
   This is not a dependent argument, so we don't extend the lifting context.

Now we need to deal with argument (3).
The way we normally proceed is to lift the kind of the binder, to see whether
it's dependent.
But here, the remainder of the kind of `a` that we're left with
after processing two arguments is just `k`.

The way forward is look up k in the lifting context, getting co1. If we're at
all well-typed, co1 will be a coercion between Π-types, with at least one binder.
So, let's decompose co1 with decomposePiCos. This decomposition needs arguments to use
to instantiate any kind parameters. Look at the type of co1. If we just
decomposed it, we would end up with coercions whose types include j, which is
out of scope here. Accordingly, decomposePiCos takes a list of types whose
kinds are the *unrewritten* types in the decomposed coercion. (See comments on
decomposePiCos.) Because the rewritten types have unrewritten kinds (because
rewriting is homogeneous), passing the list of rewritten types to decomposePiCos
just won't do: later arguments' kinds won't be as expected. So we need to get
the *unrewritten* types to pass to decomposePiCos. We can do this easily enough
by taking the kind of the argument coercions, passed in originally.

(Alternative 1: We could re-engineer decomposePiCos to deal with this situation.
But that function is already gnarly, and other call sites of decomposePiCos
would suffer from the change, even though they are much more common than this one.)

(Alternative 2: We could avoid calling decomposePiCos entirely, integrating its
behavior into simplifyArgsWorker. This would work, I think, but then all of the
complication of decomposePiCos would end up layered on top of all the complication
here. Please, no.)

(Alternative 3: We could pass the unrewritten arguments into simplifyArgsWorker
so that we don't have to recreate them. But that would complicate the interface
of this function to handle a very dark, dark corner case. Better to keep our
demons to ourselves here instead of exposing them to callers. This decision is
easily reversed if there is ever any performance trouble due to the call of
coercionKind.)

AMG TODO: update this note!

So we now call

  decomposePiCos co1
                 (Pair (forall (j :: Star). (j |> axStar) -> Star) (forall j. j -> Type))
                 [bo |> sym axStar, NoWay |> sym bc]

to get

  co5 :: Star ~ Type
  co6 :: (j |> axStar) ~ (j |> co5), substituted to
                              (bo |> sym axStar |> axStar) ~ (bo |> sym axStar |> co5)
                           == bo ~ bo
  res_co :: Type ~ Star

We then use these casts on (the rewritten) (3) and (4) to get

  (Bool |> sym axStar |> co5 :: Type)   -- (C3)
  (False |> sym bc |> co6    :: bo)     -- (C4)

We can simplify to

  Bool                        -- (C3)
  (False |> sym bc :: bo)     -- (C4)

Of course, we still must do the processing in Note [simplifyArgsWorker] to finish
the job. We thus want to recur. Our new function kind is the left-hand type of
co1 (gotten, recall, by lifting the variable k that was the return kind of the
original function). Why the left-hand type (as opposed to the right-hand type)?
Because we have casted all the arguments according to decomposePiCos, which gets
us from the right-hand type to the left-hand one. We thus recur with that new
function kind, zapping our lifting context, because we have essentially applied
it.

This recursive call returns ([Bool, False], [...], Refl). The Bool and False
are the correct arguments we wish to return. But we must be careful about the
result coercion: our new, rewritten application will have kind Type, but we
want to make sure that the result coercion casts this back to Star. (Why?
Because we started with an application of kind Star, and rewriting is homogeneous.)

So, we have to twiddle the result coercion appropriately.

Let's check whether this is well-typed. We know

  a :: forall (k :: Type). k -> k

  a (forall j. j -> Type) :: (forall j. j -> Type) -> forall j. j -> Type

  a (forall j. j -> Type)
    Proxy
      :: forall j. j -> Type

  a (forall j. j -> Type)
    Proxy
    Bool
      :: Bool -> Type

  a (forall j. j -> Type)
    Proxy
    Bool
    False
      :: Type

  a (forall j. j -> Type)
    Proxy
    Bool
    False
     |> res_co
     :: Star

as desired.

Whew.

Historical note: I (Richard E) once thought that the final part of the kind
had to be a variable k (as in the example above). But it might not be: it could
be an application of a variable. Here is the example:

  let f :: forall (a :: Type) (b :: a -> Type). b (Any @a)
      k :: Type
      x :: k

  rewrite (f @Type @((->) k) x)

After instantiating [a |-> Type, b |-> ((->) k)], we see that `b (Any @a)`
is `k -> Any @a`, and thus the third argument of `x :: k` is well-kinded.
