-- | What constitutes a back end for code generation
--
-- This module defines the `Backend` type.  A back end is responsible
-- for generating code, which means taking Cmm (and a compiled module)
-- and writing assembly language out to a file.  A back end also provides
-- a function that enables the compiler driver to run an assembler
-- on the code that is written (the "post-backend pipeline").
-- Finally, a back end has myriad /properties/.  These properties fall
-- into two categories:
--
--  * Properties that tell the compiler driver what `DynFlags` the
--    back end is compatible with, or how to adjust `DynFlags`.
--
--  * Properties (or even functions) that give the compiler driver
--    little jobs to do.  For example, the `backendCDefs` field tells
--    the compiler driver, "if you're using this back end, then these
--    are the command-line flags you should add to any invocation of
--    the C compiler."
--
--
-- This module does not define any back ends; for that you want "GHC.Driver.Backend".
-- You might start with the `prototypeBackend` or with one of the
-- existing back ends.

--
--   DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
--
--
--
-- The abstractions in this module are designed with one goal in mind:
-- make it easy to add new back ends.  In a perfect world, easy would mean:
--
--   * Changes are localized: A new back end needs only the `Backend`
--     record itself and a means of telling the driver to put that record
--     in the `backend` field of the `DynFlags`.
--
--   * The names and documentation of the property fields in the `Backend`
--     record are sufficiently descriptive that the author of a new back
--     end will be able to identify correct values without having to go
--     spelunking throughout the compiler.
--
-- In practice, this ideal is not necessarily achieved:
--
--   * When a new back end is defined, it's quite possible that the
--     compiler driver will have to be changed in some way.  Just because
--     it supports five back ends doesn't mean it will support a sixth
--     without changes.
--
--   * We don't yet know how good the names and documentation of the
--     property fields are.
--
-- The abstraction itself is inspired partly by GHC's `Platform` type and
-- partly by the /interface record/ of the [@lcc@
-- compiler](https://github.com/drh/lcc).
-- See /A Retargetable C Compiler/ by Chris Fraser and David R. Hanson.
--
-- This particular collection of properties and functions hasn't
-- really been "designed"; it's what emerged from a refactoring of
-- older code.  The real design criterion was "make it crystal clear
-- what has to be done to add a new back end."
--
--
-- One issue remains unresolved: the error messages and warning
-- messages used in the driver very much assume a "closed world": they
-- think they know all the back ends that exist, and they are not shy
-- about enumerating them.  For example, if a back end does not
-- support the export of functions to C, the message says,
--
-- > requires unregisterised, llvm (-fllvm) or native code generation (-fasm)
--
-- If the next back end added to GHC /does/ support export of
-- functions to C, I'm not sure how the author knows what messages
-- they need to change.
