ghc: panic! (the 'impossible' happened)
  GHC version 9.3.20211112:
	Cmm Hp invariant violated. The NCG backend currently assumes that
we never use Hp to read from memory. Nor any values which alias to Hp.
If you are using hand-written Cmm please adjust your code accordingly.
If you are not please report this as a GHC bug.
